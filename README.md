# Front-end-Projects
After I acquired knowledege in HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT, I really wanted to challenge myself and set a mark I will want to keep setting in the future. My first ever project I built from scratch was this 3 in one simple game website which I invented and without the help of bootstrap or any template. Its not responsive for smaller devices with screen with below 1200px. But now ,i'm a professsional after 8 months of continuous coding. I'll make it very beautiful and amazing!

I got all my Inspiration from the Holy Spirit, He spoke to me when I didn't know how to start, He guided me when I became lost in my thought about the design and above all He helped me debug a lot which was very tideous but nothing was impossible with Him. 

So if you come across this particular repository, I want you to thank the Holy Spirit again for my sake, He made this first ever beginner project a success! 

Enjoy!
